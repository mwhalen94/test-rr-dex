    nature = Bold/Relaxed
    moves = Stockpile, Scald, Earth Power/Sludge Wave/Clear Smog, Recover
    comment = The Slug eats beach sand for nourishment, in between meals it is also a great wall for anything that doesn't have grass coverage. Stockpile lets it set up its defenses, while Recover keeps the slug healthy. Its natural special bulk and massive HP even lets it come in on a special attacker to setup without needing to be specially invested. Once Gastrodon is full on Stockpile, the Slug can even take some grass type attacks.
Even without Sp.Atk investment, Gastrodon still hits quite well, allowing it to two/three hit KO a lot of Pokémon, while threatening to status the ones it cannot take out fast. Scald lets it burn some threats it might not be able to defeat otherwise, Earth Power will drop Sp.Def to make sure even another wall isn't safe, Sludge Wave lets you spread poison while dealing damage and Clear Smog stops any attempt of a setup sweeper, that isn't a Steel type.

    nature = Adamant/Jolly
    moves = Return, Fake Out, High Jump Kick/Close Combat, Play Rough/Triple Axel/U-Turn
    comment = Mega Lopunny is a massive offensive threat, as it hits any normal resist super effective with its fighting STAB and Scrappy allows it to hit Ghosts which would normally be immune to both its STABs. Mega Lopunnys high base speed also allows it to outspeed and KO most Pokémon that would otherwise be a threat to it. U-Turn allows to safely switch out against threats that it cannot KO while also dealing damage. Triple Axel allows it to break through Multiscale/Focus Sash, while Play Rough can be used to KO other Fighting types.

    nature = Adamant/Jolly
    moves = Mach Punch, Rock Tomb, Bullet Seed, Force Palm/Bulldoze
    comment = Brelooms high attack with the ability Technician wrecks havoc on a lot of Pokémon that want to set up or want to switch into it. Mach Punch deals a lot of damage to threats that would normally outspeed it, while Rock Tomb takes care of Flying types. Bullet Seed is amazing since every single hit is Technician boosted and Force Palm allows it to spread paralysis. 
Brelooms low base speed makes it hard for it to 2HKO Pokémon without risking to take massive damage back, however Breloom is a valid Pokémon to use!

    nature = Relaxed
    moves = Toxic/Toxic Spikes, Knock Off/Haze/Baneful Bunker, Recover, Scald
    comment = The Pex is an amazing wall on both sides, whatever defense its invested into it will sit on most things comfortably. Its Poison type gives it Toxic immunity, Regenerator lets it switch out against threats while being healed and Recover gives it longevity. Pex can usually take an unboosted super effective move to threaten the opponent with statuses.
Knock Off lets Toxapex remove annoying items from the opponent, Haze stops setup sweepers and Baneful Bunker helps stall out poison turns. Scald burns Steel and Poison types that cannot be poisoned.

    evs = 252, 252, 0, 0, 4, 0 // HP, Atk, Def, Sp.Atk, Sp.Def, Speed
    nature = Adamant
    moves = Surging Strikes, Drain Punch, Jet Punch, Ice Punch / Flip Turn / Close Combat
    comment = Poliwrath utilizes it's excellent typing, solid bulk, and superb movepool to form a very potent Assault Vest user. While 95 base attack isn't very high by modern standards Poliwrath makes up for it via very powerful attacks such as Surging Strikes and Close Combat. Jet Punch is also an extremely helpful offensive tool doing very solid damage with priority. Drain Punch also keeps Poliwrath healthy and synergizes excellently with Assault Vest. Ice Punch is a very solid coverage option to hit Dragons or Flying / Grass types in a pinch, and Flip Turn is an excellent tempo tool. Depending on your team composition Poliwrath can utilize a very useful water immunity in Water Absorb, or the powerful rain abusing Swift Swim to highten its offensive potential further.

    evs = 252, 4, 252, 0, 0, 0 // HP, Atk, Def, Sp.Atk, Sp.Def, Speed
    nature = Impish
    moves = Iron Defense, Recover / Rest, Body press, Mountain Gale / Iron Head / Earthquake
    comment = Do you want to feel unstoppable? Do you want to feel the fear and despair in the eyes of your enemies as they desperately try to break through your massive wall of ice? Look no further than Avalugg.

Avalugg's sky high base 184 defense paired with a decent base 95 hp stat means that even physically offensive monsters like Mega-Lucario aren't able to knock it down after you set up a couple of Iron Defenses, essentially winning you the fight on the spot.

Unlike some other body press users Avalugg isnt completely helpless against Ghosts since its 4th slot can be used for coverage and even when uninvested that base 117 attack stat is nothing to scoff at.

The only threats to this build are special attackers given Avalugg's pitiful special defense, critical hits although to a lesser degree since you still have naturally high defense, and Unaware pokemon that can outstall you quite easily.

	comment = Lickylicky is an excellent Pokemon for Hardcore E4 especially if u can't or don't wanna use golduck. This thing even walls eternamax eternatus and use explosion to safely chip things, it has bulldoze for speed lowering , knock off for utilities and along side a good mon completely destroys hail Lorelei. Mega lucario completely destroys hail Lorelei with this thing alongside it. It can also use multiple items such as focus sash assault vest for more bulk or even just leftovers, And if u think this thing is ugly atleast it's better than slaking and regigigas

    ability = Protosynthesis
    evs = 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 // HP, Atk, Def, Sp.Atk, Sp.Def, Speed
    nature = Modest
    moves = Moonblast, Shadow Ball, Mystical Fire, Thunder
    comment = Due to its excellent coverage, speed, and high special attack, Flutter Mane can deal amazing damage to every Pokemon in the Elite 4, particularly 2HKOing the majority.

When equipped with an Assault Vest, Flutter Mane can effectively defend it's self from some of the Elite 4's most powerful special attackers. Most notably, being able to sit in front of Blue's Xerneas, Eternatus, and Walking Wake, Agatha's Yveltal, Lance's Arceus-Fairy, and Lorelei's Tapu Fini and Kyurem White.

Iron Bundle, Tapu Fini, and Primal Kyogre can all be quickly handled with Thunder as your fourth move while you don't have to worry about missing in rain.

    nature = Adamant
    moves = Close Combat, Plasma Fists, Earthquake, Ice Punch / Drain Punch
    comment = Due to its high attack and great bulk when combined with an Assault Vest, Iron Hands is able to defeat the majority of the Elite 4 1v1, and acts as a check to most of it. This is made possible by the combination of Close Combat, Plasma Fists, Earthquake, and Ice Punch. Only Lance's Arceus-Fairy and Lance's Necrozma-DM are able to sit infront of Hands.

Optionally, you could go Drain Punch over Ice Punch to regain some health, but this leaves you vulnerable to the likes of Mega Rayquaza, Landorus-T, and Dragonite. You can use Iron Hands to pick up a few extra kills if you have a strategy to deal with those three.

Chien Pao

    name = Better Weavile
    item = Choice Band / Life Orb
    ability = Sword of Ruin
    evs = 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 // HP, Atk, Def, Sp.Atk, Sp.Def, Speed
    nature = Jolly
    moves = Icicle Crash, Throat Chop, Sacred Sword, Ice Shard/Sucker Punch
    comment = This is a very straightforward sweeping set. Similar to what you might use on Weavile or G-Darmanitan-Zen. A fast and powerful Ice-type is absolutely great against the E4, with the secondary typing deciding what other mons it can destroy besides a lot of what Lance would use, for example. As Chien Pao's a Dark-type, you have more coverage against Agatha's team. With its high Speed, it can outspeed most of the fastest mons the E4 has, only being outspeed by mons like Calyrex, Swift Swim Megs Swampert, and Primal Eternatus. You will mostly use Icicle Crash. Without doing calcs and just going by the move itself and the ability, which lowers the Defense of active mons that don't have Sword of Ruin by 25%, you are doing serious damage. Its SpDef isn't good, so you might not me able to take Draining Kiss from unboosted Calyrex. You could Scarf if you want, but it's better to have someone else take on Calyrex, while Chien Pao can at least mess up Yveltal. Chien Pao isn't ideal for Bruno, but for the other E4 members, it's a great mon to have. The moveset includes its best STAB options, coverage with Sacred Sword, and priority. Ice Shard could be for Primal Eternatus, I don't think I ever used Sucker Punch. You could risk taking Draco Barrage at full HP from Eternatus and retaliate with an OHKO Icicle Crash, but there's a good chance Draco Barrage will OHKO.

In conclusion, if you want a new kind of Weavile to play with, or in general, a new Ice-type sweeper, Chien Pao's highly recommended.
